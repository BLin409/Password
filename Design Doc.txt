Design:
Password keeping software. Used to keep passwords with one master password. Encrypt file with the master password.
Master password is used to patch missing binary bits in the password file. Once the correct password is inputed, the file will
be patched correctly and opening the password file will show a list of passwords and their origins.

Possible Problems:
-Not yet sure what algorithm to use to do this.
-Passwords could potentially be sniffed out by listing all binary data without any passwords.
  -A file might look like this when printed out:
    User: John Doe
    P s w rd: ke b ar
  -From inspection we can see this is keyboard or bruteforce until keyboard is found. Must correctly encrypt information and
   password file.

Implementation:
-main.cpp
-encrypt.cpp
-decrypt.cpp

Pseudorandom Number Encryptor
-Design Idea:
  -Password is hashed into a 32-bit number and acted as seed to the Pseudorandom number generator
  -Number returned by the random number generator is xor'd with the bytes in the file
  -Encrypted file will be in binary format
  -Decryption will be done in the same way as encryption because xor is used
-Progress:
  -Basic functionality completed and tested
  -Currently only one file can be encrypted/decrypted at a time
-Next Step:
  -Improve user interface
  -Take in regex filename, so a list of files can be encrypted/decrpyted at once
